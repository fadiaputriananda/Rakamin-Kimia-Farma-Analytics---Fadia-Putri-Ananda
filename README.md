# Rakamin-Kimia-Farma-Analytics---Fadia-Putri-Ananda
As a Big Data Analytics Intern at Kimia Farma, in this project, we are tasked with analyzing and evaluating Kimia Farma's business performance from 2020 to 2023. 
The challenge in Big Data Analytics at Kimia Farma is to create an analysis table that includes several datasets to be analyzed using BigQuery. 
The results of the analysis table are then used to create a dashboard that analyzes Kimia Farma's performance from 2020 to 2023 using Looker Studio. 

From the dashboard, we can explore data that can provide recommendations and data analysis for Kimia Farma. The datamart used to create the analysis table, among others:
